# TopPizzaToppings
Find top 20 most frequently ordered pizza configurations

Problem :
A pizza chain wants to know which topping combinations are most popular for Build Your Own pizzas. Given the sample of orders at http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json, write an application (in C#, F# or JS) to output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza configurations, listing the toppings for each along with the number of times that pizza configuration has been ordered.
